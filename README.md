Practical, reusable setup guides for developer workflows.

This repository focuses on **copy/paste-friendly documentation** you can use to bootstrap machines, configure tooling, and reduce setup friction.

## Why this repo

- Reusable templates with placeholders you can adapt quickly
- Step-by-step instructions aimed at reliability and repeatability
- Troubleshooting sections for common failure modes

| [RooCode Local Indexing Setup (Ollama + Qdrant)](./roocode-indexing-setup.md) | Local embeddings + vector database setup for code indexing workflows | Developers configuring local AI-assisted code retrieval |

## Quick Start
